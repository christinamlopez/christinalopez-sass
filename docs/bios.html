        <h3> Harvey Dale</h3>
        <p> Harvey Dale hails from Austin, Texas and says his life changed the day he got stuck in a tire swing. 
            On Septmeber 18, 1996, Harvey swung too high on the tire swing in his grandma's backyard and spent 14 hours stuck upon the highest branch. 
            During the 9th hour, Harvey decided then and there that he would become the best punk rocker in existence. 
            Since then, Harvey has been writing poems, concoting earbleeding riffs, and thumping basslines. 
            Harvey met Tori and Dan Bill during his undergraduate years at Texas State. After bouncing from small town clubs, to frat house backyards, and festival stages, Harvey Dale is ready for greatness.</p>

        <h3>Tori Johnson Boston</h3>
        <p> Tori Johnson Boston, born in Madison, Wisconsin, learned piano at 3 years old. 
            Tori was considred a musical prodigy and performed with symphonies and orchestras around the country. 
            Tori moved to San Antonio with her family as a teenager and decided she was done with piano, but not music. 
            While attending Texas State, Tori landed a job at Guitar Center and spent most of her shifts learning bass guitar. 
            She met Harvey and Dan Bill when Dan Bill broke a crash cymbal at Guitar Center. 
            Tori joined thier band and has been a integral, solid piece of foundation for the band. Some say she's the cement that holds the band together.</p>

        <h3>Dan-Bill Bishop</h3>
        <p> Dan-Bill Bishop has always been rambunctious. Born to two police officers, Dan-Bill felt it was only right to stand up to 'the man.' 
            When his parents insisted he learn an instrument, so he chose drumset. He knew his parents would hate the noise so he tried to practice as loud as possible. 
            Dan-Bill felt safest with the punk scene and says its where he feels the most like himself. 
            After meeting Harvey in math class at Texas State and breaking a cymbal at Guitar Hero, Dan-Bill has been the heart of the band. 
            With constant and heavy beats, Dan-Bill keeps the band's blood flowing.</p>
